I'm a music composer and producer, mainly active in the belgian band
[Roscoe](https://roscoeband.com/). We have released 3 LPs with the
[PIAS](https://www.pias.com/) record label (two of them have been awarded "Best
Album of the Year" in Belgium). We've also had the chance of playing in great
venues and music festivals in Belgium and abroad.
