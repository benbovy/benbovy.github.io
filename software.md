See my [GitHub profile]({{ site.github }}) for details about my work on
open-source software.

### Python / PyData / Xarray

I'm a regular contributor to the Python Scientific (SciPy/PyData) ecosystem.
I'm a core developer of [Xarray](https://xarray.dev/), a popular library for
handling N-dimensional arrays and datasets. My work on Xarray is focused on its
labeled indexing capabilities. I also maintain and/or contribute to a few Xarray
extensions such as
[Xarray-simlab](https://github.com/xarray-contrib/xarray-simlab),
[Xoak](https://github.com/xarray-contrib/xoak),
[Xpublish](https://github.com/xpublish-community/xpublish),
[Xvec](https://github.com/xarray-contrib/xvec) and
[Xdggs](https://github.com/xarray-contrib/xdggs).

Besides Xarray, I have created or contributed to other Python libraries for
geospatial analysis and atmospheric chemistry.

### Fastscape

I maintain [Fastscape](https://github.com/fastscape-lem): a set of software
tools for simulating the evolution of the surface topography over geological
time scales. Fastscape is focused on performance, reusability and accessibility.
It is used for research, education and outreach purposes.

### Geigr

I created and maintain [Geigr](https://github.com/geigr), which for now consists
in a few Jupyter (widget) extension libraries
([Ipytone](https://github.com/geigr/ipytone),
[IpyMIDI](https://github.com/geigr/ipymidi)) aimed at exposing the web browser's
audio and MIDI capabilities to Python and Jupyter users. Although still work in
progress, those libraries integrated with the whole Jupyter ecosystem together
provide accessible and interactive tools for exploring data with sound
(sonification) and for learning sound design.
