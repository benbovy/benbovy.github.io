See my [GitHub profile]({{ site.github }}) for details about my work on
open-source software.

### Python - PyData - Xarray

I'm a regular contributor to the Python Scientific (SciPy/PyData) ecosystem. I'm
a core developer of [Xarray](https://xarray.dev/), a popular library for
handling N-dimensional arrays and datasets. My work on Xarray is focused around
its labeled indexing capabilities. I also maintain and/or contribute to a few
Xarray extensions such as
[Xarray-simlab](https://github.com/xarray-contrib/xarray-simlab),
[Xoak](https://github.com/xarray-contrib/xoak),
[Xpublish](https://github.com/xpublish-community/xpublish),
[Xvec](https://github.com/xarray-contrib/xvec) and
[Xdggs](https://github.com/xarray-contrib/xdggs).

Besides Xarray, I have created or contributed to Python libraries for geospatial
analysis and atmospheric chemistry.

### Fastscape

I maintain [Fastscape](https://github.com/fastscape-lem): a set of software
tools for simulating the evolution of the Earth surface topography over
geological time scales. Fastscape is designed around performance, reusability
and accessibility. It is used for research, education and outreach purposes (I
use it for art too).

### Geigr

I have created and maintain [Geigr](https://github.com/geigr), which for now
consists in a few Jupyter (widget) extension libraries
([Ipytone](https://github.com/geigr/ipytone),
[IpyMIDI](https://github.com/geigr/ipymidi)) aimed at exposing the web browser's
audio and MIDI capabilities to Python and Jupyter users. Although still work in
progress, those libraries together with the rest of the Jupyter ecosystem
provide a powerful, accessible and interactive environment for exploring data
with sound (sonification) and for learning sound design.
