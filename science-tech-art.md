I have a background in Physical Geography / Geomatics and completed a PhD in
Geomorphology. My research was mainly focused on better understanding the
influence of climate on the long-term erosion of hillslopes and rivers with the
help of numerical modeling. See my [Google
Scholar](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=2cKCdMYAAAAJ&hl=en) and
[Orcid](https://orcid.org/0009-0001-4011-3574) profiles for more details.

I'm passionate about crossing boundaries between science, technology and art.
Combined together, these are fantastic sources of inspiration for creativity,
innovation and education.
